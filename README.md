This repository contains a Python function `calculate_average` that demonstrates an uncommon error in handling edge cases during average calculation. The function has issues when dealing with an empty list, returning 0 instead of explicitly signaling an error condition.  It also fails when encountering non-numeric data types within the input list, resulting in a `TypeError`.  The solution demonstrates improved error handling and input validation.
